/* Reading and Visualizing EEG Data
 * by Christian Henry
 
 * Reads in EEG data through the microphone input of the 
 * computer, then displays the signal in time, its frequency
 * components, and then averages of frequencies that estimate
 * the concentration of different brain waves.
 *
 * For reference, the frequency bars are ordered/classified as
 * follows:
 *   1 - blue -------- delta
 *   2 - blue/purple - theta
 *   3 - purple ------ alpha 
 *   4 - purple/red -- low beta
 *   5 - dark red ---- mid beta
 *   6 - red --------- high beta
 * 
 * This sketch will measure all brain waves, from 0 - 30 Hz. It does
 * best, however, measuring alpha waves across the occipital lobe.
 * To view this function, play the program, click the window to
 * make sure its in "focus", and hit the "a" key to bandpass the alpha
 * waves only. The alpha wave bar is the 3rd one (purple), and should
 * increase in height by 2-3x when you close your eyes and relax
 * (you'll see it for a second or two after you open your eyes, before it
 * averages back down).

/* One issue: when taking the FFT of the data, it seems as if
the frequency bands have a bandwidth of 1.33 instead of 1, as 
60Hz noise peaks out at band 45. This is worked around by using
the scaleFreq parameter, which is used frequently. */
