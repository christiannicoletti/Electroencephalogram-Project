# Contributing to the Electroencephalogram-Project!

Pull requests are super awesome and convenient, they help avoid merge conflicts and keep everyone up to date!

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting new features
* by writing or editing documentation
* by writing code ( **no patch is too small** : fix typos, add comments, clean up inconsistent whitespace )
* by refactoring code
* by closing [issues](https://github.com/cwnicoletti/electroencephalogram-project/issues)

## Submitting an Issue

* We use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/cwnicoletti/electroencephalogram-project/issues) to track bugs and features.
* Before submitting a bug report or feature request, 
  check to make sure it hasn't already been submitted.

## Cleaning up issues

* Issues that have no response from the submitter will be closed after 30 days.
* Issues will be closed once they're assumed to be fixed or answered. If the
  maintainer is wrong, it can be opened again.
* If your issue is closed by mistake, please understand and explain the issue.
  We will happily reopen the issue!
